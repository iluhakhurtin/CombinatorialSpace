	//set randomly, the 3d unbroken subspace always has the same vector if all the bits are combined by logical OR.
	//As a result, such a logic guarantees smoth change for every summarizing vector's bits if the subspace is moved
	//in a vicinity of a point. Thus, a code space vector (i.e. code) has up to 27 set to 1 bits but can have less if some seeds points have matching bits
	//which are changed smoothly in correspondence to the distance from each other.
	//In other words, this logic creates a 3d codes space every code in which has up to 27 bits changing smoothly
	//in relation to the coordinates of this space. One of the axis in the space (a) is looped and can have values
	//from 0 to 9.
